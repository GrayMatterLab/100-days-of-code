# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: May 01, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Refreshers on Big O Notation, Cover Arrays, Built Bottom Sheet 

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.
